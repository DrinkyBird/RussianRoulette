# Russian Roulette

This is a plugin for Bukkit/Spigot/Paper/etc. Minecraft server.
It adds a command `/russianroulette` (aliased to `/rr`).
When executed, there is a 1 in 6 chance of the player being permanently banned from the server -
and a 5 in 6 chance of a dramatic *Click...*

The command requires the `russianroulette.command` permission (which should be enabled by default.)
